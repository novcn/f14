      This problem asks you about operational semantics for a simple language
      with assignment and addition. The expressions of this language are given
      by the grammar
      $$
        e ::= n \mid x \mid x = e \mid e + e
      $$
      where \(n\) can be any number (0, 1, 2, 3, …). We can define the
      operational semantics with
      respect to a mapper \(\sigma : \mathit{Var} \to \mathcal{N}\), where
      \(\mathit{Var}\) is the set of variables that may appear in expressions
      and \(\mathcal{N}\) is the set of numbers that can be values of variables.
      To have some reasonable terminology, we will call \(\sigma\) a
      <em>store</em> and a pair \(\pair{e, \sigma}\) a <em>state</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a program executes, we hope to reach a <em>final state</em> \(\pair{
      e, \sigma}\) where \(e\) is a number, which we will call a <em>value</em>.

          Let's look at arithmetic expressions. Two rules for evaluating
          summands of a sum are
          $$
            \begin{array}{rcl}
              \pair{a_1,\sigma} &amp; \longrightarrow &amp; \pair{a'_1,\sigma'} \\ \hline
              \pair{a_1 + a_2, \sigma} &amp; \longrightarrow &amp;
                \pair{a'_1 + a_2, \sigma'}
            \end{array}
          $$
          $$
            \begin{array}{rcl}
              \pair{a_2, \sigma} &amp; \longrightarrow &amp; \pair{a'_2, \sigma'} \\ \hline
              \pair{n + a_2, \sigma} &amp; \longrightarrow &amp;
                \pair{n + a'_2, \sigma' }
            \end{array}
          $$
        </p>
        <p>
          We assume that it is a single execution step to add two numbers, so
          we have the rule
          $$
            \begin{array}{c}
              n, m, p \text{ are numbers with } n + m = p \\ \hline
              \pair{n + m, \sigma} \quad \longrightarrow \quad \pair{p, \sigma}
            \end{array}
          $$
        </p>
        <p>
          The value of a variable depends on the store, as specified by this
          evaluation rule
          $$
            \pair{x, \sigma} \quad \longrightarrow \quad \pair{\sigma(x),\sigma}
          $$
        </p>
        <p>
          Show how these rules let you evaluate an expression \(x+y\) to
          a sum of numbers. Assume \(\sigma\) is a store with \(\sigma(x) = 2\)
          and \(\sigma(y) = 3\). Write your answer as an execution sequence of
          the form below, <em>with an explanation</em>.
          $$
            \pair{x + y, \sigma} \longrightarrow
              \pair{\blank + \blank, \sigma} \longrightarrow
              \pair{\blank + \blank, \sigma} \longrightarrow
              \pair{\blank, \sigma}
          $$
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          \(\mathit{Put}\) is the function on stores with \(\mathit{Put}(\sigma,
          x, n) = \sigma'\) with \(\sigma'(x) = n\) and \(\sigma'(y) =
          \sigma(y)\) for all variables \(y\) other than \(x\). Using
          \(\mathit{Put}\), the execution rule for assignment can be written
          $$
            \pair{x = n, \sigma} \quad\longrightarrow\quad
              \pair{n, \mathit{Put}(\sigma, x, n)}
          $$
        </p>
        <p>
          In this particular language, an assignment changes the store, as
          usual. In addition, as you can see from the operational semantics of
          assignment, an assignment is an expression whose value is the value
          assigned.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we have an assignment with an expression that has not been
          evaluated to a number, then we can use this evaluation rule:
          $$
            \begin{array}{rcl}
              \pair{e, \sigma} &amp; \longrightarrow &amp; \pair{e', \sigma'} \\ \hline
              \pair{x = e, \sigma} &amp; \longrightarrow &amp; \pair{x = e', \sigma'}
            \end{array}
          $$
        </p>
        <p>
          Combining these rules with the rules from part a, show how to execute
          \(\pair{x = x + 3, \sigma}\) when \(\sigma\) is a store with
          \(\sigma(x) = 1\). Write your answer as an execution sequence of the
          form below, <em>with an explanation</em>.
          $$
            \pair{x = x + 3, \sigma} \longrightarrow
              \pair{x = \blank + \blank, \sigma} \longrightarrow
              \pair{x = \blank, \sigma} \longrightarrow
              \pair{\blank, \blank}
          $$
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Show how to execute \(\pair{(x = 3) + x, \sigma}\) in the same level of
        detail, <em>including an explanation</em>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Show how to execute \(\pair{x = (x = x + 3) + (x = x + 5), \sigma}\)
        when \(\sigma\) is a store with \(\sigma(x) = 1\) in the same level of
        detail, <em>including an explanation</em>.

    Use lambda calculus reduction to find a shorter expression for \((\lambda p.
    \lambda q. \lambda r. p q r)(\lambda p. \lambda q. p q r)\). Begin by
    renaming bound variables. You should do all possible reductions to get to
    the shortest possible expression. What goes wrong if you do not rename bound
    variables?

      A programmer is having difficulty debugging the following C program. In
      theory, on an “ideal” machine with infinite memory, this
      program would run forever. (In practice, this program crashes because it
      runs out of memory, since extra space is required every time a function
      call is made.)
    </p>
<pre>int f(int (*g)(...)){ /* g points to a function that returns an int */
  return g(g);
}
int main(){
  int x;
  x = f(f);
  printf("Value of x = %d\n", x);
  return 0;
}</pre>

      Explain the behavior of the program by translating the definition of
      <code>f</code> into lambda calculus and then reducing the application
      <code>f(f)</code>. This program assumes that the type checker does not
      check the types of arguments to functions.
