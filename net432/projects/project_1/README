We were able to create a dynamic chatroom emulator for this programming assignment.
The chatroom consists of a server and of multiple clients.
The biggest problem that we ran into was the rebroadcast of information from one client
to another, through the server.

The server has access to two dynamic data structures, a linked-list structure 
to hold information about the different chat channels, and a user structure to 
keep track of who is on which channel.

Good news: We were able to implement these data structures robustly and without leaks on the server side. However, when it came to redistributing the organized information to the 
clients we ran into some snags. That is, we are able to receive all information from each 
client and organize it correctly, but we were unable to redistribute some of the information to every subscribed user.

Creating a correctly formatted packet containing the information to be 
redistributed proved to be nontrivial.

Our clients and server support
/join <channel>
/exit
/switch
/who <channel>

Our server alone supports
/list <channels>
/say <response> * Receives correctly, does not relay message

This program may easily be compiled with the make command.
We used many flags while compiling to make sure that our 
code is error free. These flags that we were given to include are
-g -W -Wall -Werror
